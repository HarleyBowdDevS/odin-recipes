            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Place one chicken breast on a cutting board. Cover chicken breast with plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet until about 2 centimeters thick. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts.</p>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</p>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a very-large skillet over medium-high heat.Add chicken and cook until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a breast reads at least 74 degrees C, 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway. Remove chicken from the skillet; set aside.</p>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>Add asparagus to the skillet. Cook over medium-high, until bright green and crisp-tender, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove asparagus from the skillet; set aside.</p>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>Juice half of the lemon (about 22 milliliters juice) and slice the remaining half into wedges.</p>
            <h4>Step 7</h4>
            <p>Add lemon juice, whipping cream, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and Italian seasoning to the skillet</p>
            <h4>Step 8</h4>
            <p>Simmer over medium-high, scraping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits, 2 minutes. Season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.</p>
            <h4>Step 9</h4>
            <p>Add chicken and asparagus back into the skillet. Simmer until heated through and sauce reaches desired consistency, about 1 minute. Serve with lemon wedges.</p>
